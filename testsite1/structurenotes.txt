this is just for me cuz im stupid
website structure:
1 app
app is '' and 'appname' paths
app switches between home (gets all the data)
home: specify input type
click on each link to get to other page with pre-made output

and other pages (data display)
other pages: resource finder, quiz maker, etc.

extra: way to put output of other page back as input for next
