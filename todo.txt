Current options:
    Study Resources
    Practice Questions

structure idea:
input is processed reactively
when input is received, it is in a textBlock class
this can be quiz questions, links, text, ect.
class contains this information as well as needed metadata
io file calls functions from parsing file
parsing file calls functions from processing file
processing file output is re-parsed using the metadata information
and then parsing output is outoutted (FORMATTING)

main file does startup tasks and stuff
